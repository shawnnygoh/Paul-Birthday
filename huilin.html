    HAPPIEST BDAY PAUL!!! From the span of one year, I can safely say you went from ah boys to man leh. It was nice hearing your faith stories and just about ur life in small group for the past 1.5 years. I honestly think you’re someone that really process your thoughts carefully and will think through what happen, from the way u share about ur life. Also quite sad that you’re a lil busy sailing the ship nowadays and I don’t really have much opportunity to talk to you! But know that I’m really grateful to have a friend like u and it was really fun talking to you (much so before u enlisted haha). All the best for army ok! Tough time will eventually pass and I pray that God gives u strength to endure all things. Hope u have a blasted and blessed fun bday!
