    Happy Birthday Paul! Hope you are doing well and enjoying army life hehe. Blessed to be in the same lg. You are a very chill person to hang out with, I enjoyed the times we had conversations together.Really encouraged by the fact that despite the officers using harsh words on you, you don't allow the words to condemn you but continue to say things in positive way :'). As you become a year older, I pray that God will constantly providing you physical and mental strength as you are on your NS journey. Though sometimes the people are not so nice, continue to stand firm in your beliefs and be the light of people around you! I believe your kindness will impact the people around! If there's anything happened, you can always share in the group chat. All the best in army and jiayous!!! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
