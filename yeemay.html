    Happy birthday Paul! Cant believe you are younger than the majority of us ðŸ˜¢. Haha, that aside hopefully army has been ok so far. Praying that God continues to guide you even when you r in army and also when tough times come. Its rlly nice hearing how even when u r in army u still share the word with the ppl around you like ur bunk mates. Never extinguish the fire in u that u have for God!. Happy blessed birthday :)
