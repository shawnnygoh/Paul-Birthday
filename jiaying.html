    Happy blessed birthday Paul!!! The level of obedience you have towards God is just so humbling for people to see!! Havenâ€™t been able to chat with you much ever since we went into different small groups but I hope that you have been doing great still, and working on your e-guit skills HAHAHAHA. Happy blessed birthday, and I pray that God will use you as His light while you are in NS and bring many many lost friends to come to know Him!
