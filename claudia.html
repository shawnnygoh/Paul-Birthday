    Happy Birthday Paul!!! 🎉 Thank you for being a part of this LG 😊 Ohnoo hope you’re not gonna spend your birthday in army.. haha but if you are then no choice only can celebrate before/after! Jiayous in army 💪🏼 So encouraged by your spirit of excellence there, especially since I believe the environment in army is not always very easy to stay positive in! It’s awesome that you’re doing your best, so even if things do not turn out well at the moment, I am sure God is already very pleased with you so just keep doing what you’re doing! I pray that God will cause so much growth to happen in you in this upcoming year and that you may receive His favour everywhere you go. Also, just want to thank you for starting to serve in LG worship in the past year! 😊 and I’m so inspired that you still worship with your guitar so often even while serving NS now!! 😂👍🏼 Hope that you don’t feel like you belong any less since you spend less time with LG nowadays.. you’re still just as important and significant to LG as anybody else yea :) Just be yourself and share all ur NS stories with us! HAHA have a great birthday!
