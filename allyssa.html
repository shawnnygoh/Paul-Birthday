    <br>
    tbh hearing ur schedule (trainings + studying + planning for stuff) makes me wna faint man.. can rly tell that itâ€™s rly overwhelming.. but i pray that u will always be reminded of the power of the One who is in you has ok! with His power, you can conquer anything! He has never left you and loves you alot even in the hard times where you canâ€™t see His goodness at all! so continue to seek Him though itâ€™s tough and demoralising, and know that all this will pass ok! u can do it!!
