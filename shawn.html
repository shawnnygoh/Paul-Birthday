    Happy birthday Paul! 
    <br>
    <br>
    Hope you have a blessed birthday! You’re one of the most genuine and humble people I've met and it's truly been a gift to have been able to meet you! Celebrating your birthday on ship may not seem ideal at first but I’m sure you and your fellow officers find a way to make it work! It'll definitely be a memorable experience and I hope you're doing well and enjoy yourself! Although training may be tough and rough like the waves out in the storming oceans, you are tougher and have all the things you need to overcome whatever challenges are thrown at you with God! What doesn't kill you makes you stronger and I'm sure all this training is all part of God’s plan to mould you into a stronger person than you already are! Hope to see you again after your stint in the sea and jiayouss!
    <br>

    ~ Shawn
