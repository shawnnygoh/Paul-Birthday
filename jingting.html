    happy blessed birthday Paul!!!!! You’re amazing and I’m sooooo encouraged by your heart for God… I love hearing your army stories and I’m always so inspired by your seeking heart… even though you’re unable to make it for LG, I’m thankful for all the conversations after service! You’ve taught me the importance of keeping my heart soft and to continually seek after God even when times are tough. I’ve seen how you’ve took your relationship with Him seriously and it’s so heartwarming :-‘) I pray that as you grow a year older, you’ll continue to love God with all your heart and know how loved you are by Him!! I pray that in all things, you’ll learn to rely on Him because He is the One who sustains you :) happy birthday Paul, have a great one!! JIAYOUS being on the ship too!!!! Praying for you! Exciting times!!
