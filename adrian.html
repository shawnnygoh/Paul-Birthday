    happy 21st birthday paul!! amazing that I've now come to know you for like 3?? years?!?!?! you're such a mature person and always so willing to serve others with a smile on your face! it is always an absolute joy to be around you and I love our conversations! you're growing to be such a great man of God, and I pray that each step of the way you continue to grow more and more intimate with Him, more Christlike each day. Your courage to step out of your comfort zone to challenge yourself in the navy is also something that so encourages me! we all know how difficult it is but you were so willing to grow and challenge yourself that it never discouraged you, and it's something we all can learn from you! to face hardship with a smile and ready to grow! I pray that each and everyday you will enjoy this journey that God has placed you on, and you will grow to be such a great leader! Thank you for journeying with us and choosing to be share your life with us, we can't wait to continue on this adventure with you! happy birthday paul!
