    Happy blessed birthday Paul!! Wah Paul, I’m so happy to hear that you’ve been growing in army leh. Like from the things that you’ve been sharing over random conversations on Sat, I’m really so encouraged to hear that you’ve been making efforts to keep your heart soft. Pretty cool to hear about things that have been happening in army from you!! Like how you have to fix the boat yourself, learn how to swim and y’all have rotations to learn how to command/ steer the ship? I remember that you shared about forming a small group in army!! That is super cool manz! HAHA I’m sure there must be a lot of pressure when you’ve started something. But always remember that God uses willing hearts, you don’t have to have the most Bible knowledge/ etc to keep this going ya!! Even as you continue in your army journey, I pray that you’ll always remember that there’s community back here that you can journey with too, and that you’ll continue to be humble and sit at His feet to receive from Him. :))) HAHAH let your sister know that we said happy birthday to her too!! Happy birthday Bernice!!(HAHA hope I got her name and spelling right!
