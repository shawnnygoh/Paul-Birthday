    happy birthday Paul!!! wah somehow ah it feels like we hvent gotten the chance to talk more than 10 sentences bfore ohno ðŸ˜‚ hopefully we get to be in the same dinner table sometime soon so can hear abt ur life updates!! but frm what ik ure in navy and i believe u must not hv an easy life there!! read about the bible Paul recently and it's so cool that u hv the same name haha!! just like how the bible Paul lived out his faith despite being well aquainted with suffering, may you also choose to rejoice, give thanks, and be content even in your hardships, as you are encouraged that God strengthens you and is our only true source of hope, joy and peace :) blessed birthday again and hope u have a great one!!ðŸŽ‰
