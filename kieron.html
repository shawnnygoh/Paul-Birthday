    Happy birthdayyy paull!! Wowow what a journey sia, although i only met you during covid it feels like i’ve known you for quite a long time HAHAHA. Very blessed to have known you in this period of time and to have hung out wif you. but now abit hard ah cus u sailing all HAHAHA. praying that you remain safe as you continue on on this journey and that you’ll rely on God for the strength and courage to push forward. if anything you know you can ask for help or prayer, we always here one so u dunnid to be scared. This bdae probs gonna be a bit demoralising cus if i not wrong u will be at sea but is ok at least got nice view and scenery on ur bdae HAHA. Anyways make the best out of it and have a blast
