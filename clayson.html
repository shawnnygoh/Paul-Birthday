    Happy birthday Paul! Haha hope you're enjoying navy so far! Big decision to make, because I wouldn't do it haha, but u do you, if that's where God calls you to br! I pray that as you grow 1 year older, that you will deepen more in your relationship with God, and that through Him you will continue to grow even more, even as you face problems and troubled in navy, or in your life! Happy birthday!
