    Happy birthday ðŸŽ‰itâ€™s so cool to always come see you on sat and hear more about what has been happening in your life, and how God has been moving. It might be a short while, but it does encourage me. Even though this period is very tough, Iâ€™m confident that as God calls you to this place , He will guide and provide. I pray that even as you become a year wiser, that you will too grow closer to God, and be the light that God has called you to be. Canâ€™t wait for you to be able to join more frequently and hang out with the rest of the lifegroup. Have a blessed birthday eat more before you sail hahah
