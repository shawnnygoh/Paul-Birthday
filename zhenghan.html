    Happy birthday Paul! Yay finally one more regular in Lifegroup! Hope OCS has not taken its toll on you and you are still doing well! The journey definitely isn't easy but God's got your back through this! He won't leave nor forsake you even through all the tough times that's to come. When the going gets tough, may you lean on Him for strength to sustain you and also rely on Him for guidance as you continue being the salt and light through this journey! It's really amazing how far you've come, from how I've known you as a student, to a recruit and now almost an officer! The end is near so don't give up! I just know you are going to be an outstanding officer who will impact the lives of so many other people in time to come! Jiayou for the rest of this journey! Will always be rooting for you!

    To lead, To excel, To overcome!

    Happy birthday!
