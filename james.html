    Happy birthday Paul!! Haven't been catching up with you lately. NS really takes away our attention and energy. But then again, I realised that NS could help teach us how to manage our time and priorities. Especially for you when you're considering Navy as your full-time career. I hope you're building mental resilience against the stress of Navy. But more than that, I hope you can balance your work and life. I think one good way to help is putting it in a perspective that you're just balancing people. At work, you got people to deal with. At home or at church, you got people that mean a deeper level for you to deal with. Gauge your balance through seeing how much time you spend with different people. But at the end of the day, enjoy spending time with everyone. This way, you will enjoy the process and find a work life balance feeling inside you. Again, I'm always a text away if you need anything. I'm trying my best to cope through new seasons in NS and I think at some point I'm gonna need to talk to my friends about it. I'm very thankful to have you as my close friend that I can count on. Thought the last time I'll ever see you is in poly. Who knew it's gonna be a lifetime HAHA. So glad it's you and not Justi- jkjk. Thanks for the fun times we had and times where you were my listening ear after every Saturday at our bus interchange. That annoying robot is still around terrorizing woodlands interchange btw. Also, I hope you find closure for Leo :(( kind of a bad move from that owner. But I'm sure, as a pet owner, he's great at it. Again, happy birthday Paul! Hope to hang out soon and put our work behind for a day.
