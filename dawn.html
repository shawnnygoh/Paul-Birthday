    happiest of all birthdays to you Paul!! 
    <br>
    I hope this day will bring you lots of happiness, fun and lots and lots of cake :D
    <br>
    It’s been such a blessing getting to know you and I really enjoy the conversations that we’ve had, you’ve got a lot of interesting stories to tell heheh 
    <br>
    You’re a really chill person to be around and it’s always a good time with you + by the way you talk about your sister, like, you’re such a good brother too??? like i see your insta stories sometimes and y’all are so cute  ahahah
    <br>
    As you grow older, I pray that you’ll grow in wisdom and learn to have a greater reliance on God regardless the season that you’re in. Remember that as long as you have God, you’ll be okay :))
    <br>
    side note: your bird is really cute ahhh
